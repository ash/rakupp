# Module findings — the v2 ecosystem campaign's triage log

Findings from running battery modules (ash/raku-module-battery pins) under
rakupp — both rakupp gaps and module-side quirks. Kept here for us; **never
reported upstream to module authors**. Companion docs: V2-MODULES-PLAN.md,
ECOSYSTEM-TOP50.md.

1. **The top-50 is not dependency-closed** (2026-07-22): 12 of 50 dists need
   out-of-set transitive deps (Trap, Hash::Merge, …) or native libraries at
   load time. Action: vendor the REA transitive closure of the working set.
2. **rakupp warns-and-continues on a missing `use`** where Rakudo hard-fails
   at compile time. Good for exploration, wrong for conformance — rakupp
   needs a strict mode (or default) that dies like Rakudo; harness counts
   such loads as PARTIAL meanwhile.
3. **rakupp splits RAKULIB on colon; Rakudo on comma** — phase-1 fix: accept
   the comma form (with `file#`/`inst#` prefixes) in rakupp.
4. **JSON::Fast 0.19 does not parse under rakupp** — RESOLVED 2026-07-22.
   The blame initially fell on `Q/\u/` at Fast.pm6:130, but Q// was innocent
   (and my "proof" was zsh's echo expanding \t itself — always probe with
   files). The real bug: `module M:ver<0.19> { … }` — parseClass had no
   name-adverb handling, so `:ver` failed the brace check and the package
   took the unit-form branch, swallowing the block up to its first `;`.
   Fixed (adverbs parsed + recorded on ClassDecl: ver/auth/api — the fields
   phase-1 resolution needs anyway). Also exposed that the Tier-3 harness
   must count module PARSE warnings as PARTIAL, not LOAD.
4b. **JSON::Fast needs an nqp:: subset** (next leg): parses + partially loads
   now, dies at `nqp::list_i`. Full inventory (~50 distinct ops): hot ones
   iseq_i/if/push_s/stmts/add_i/bindpos/ordat/istype/sub_i/eqat/substr/
   bindpos_i/while/elems/chars…; NB nqp::if/while/until/unless/stmts are
   LAZY macros — parser rewrites to native constructs, not builtins; the
   ~40 leaf ops (int math, str, list_i/_s, cclass) are builtin work.
5. **rakupp `substr` on long strings is O(position)**: 20k one-char substrs
   near position 4M took 116 s (5.8 ms each) — codepoint scanning from the
   string start each call. Makes naive char-walking parsers quadratic; needs
   an ASCII/byte fast path or offset cache in rakupp. (JSONLite works around
   it by walking a .comb array.)
6. **rakupp RUN-MAIN doesn't val()-allomorph NAMED args**: `Int :$top` with
   `--top=10` dies X::TypeCheck::Binding (positionals are allomorphed;
   nameds arrive as plain Str).
