# Raku++

A from-scratch implementation of the [Raku](https://raku.org) programming
language in **C++17, with no third-party dependencies** — a hand-written lexer,
parser, and tree-walking evaluator that runs real Raku (classes, roles, grammars,
regexes, multi-dispatch, junctions, lazy sequences, a bignum tower,
Unicode-correct strings, and concurrency), can also **compile** a program to a
standalone native binary, and — as **[Raku.js](rakujs/)** — **runs in the browser**
via WebAssembly, no server required. It is not a fork of Rakudo and shares no code with it;
it targets the *language*, measured against [**Roast**](https://github.com/Raku/roast),
the official Raku test suite.

**Status:** measured per individual test, **~89% of Roast passes** — 193,883 of
~216,066 tests the suite declares, counting the tests in files that abort before
running (their `plan N` is read from source). On the stricter all-or-nothing bar,
**578 / 1,462 files fully pass (~39%)** — a file counts only if *every* assertion
in it passes. Early-stage, growing test-first. See [the highlights](docs/HIGHLIGHTS.md)
for the key features in bullets, [the overview](docs/OVERVIEW.md) for
a one-page tour, [the full guide](docs/GUIDE.md) for the complete picture,
[COUNTING.md](docs/COUNTING.md) for exactly how these are defined, or the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for what each release brought.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS)

```sh
brew tap ash/rakupp
brew install rakupp        # or: brew install --HEAD rakupp   (latest main)
```

Apple Silicon installs a **prebuilt binary** (no compile); Intel builds from
source. Homebrew itself requires the Xcode Command Line Tools — if `brew install`
says to install them, run `xcode-select --install` first.

### Prebuilt binaries (macOS, Linux, Windows)

Every release ships self-contained archives on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/ash/rakupp/releases/latest):
`rakupp-macos-universal.tar.gz` (Apple Silicon + Intel, macOS 11+),
`rakupp-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` (static libstdc++ — no dependencies), and
`rakupp-windows-x64.zip` (static CRT — no redistributable needed). Unpack
keeping the `bin/ lib/ include/` layout together (that's what `--exe` uses)
and put `bin/` on your `PATH`.

### Build from source

```sh
# Needs a C++17 compiler + CMake → produces build/rakupp
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build

# Install onto $PATH (binary + the runtime that --exe links against)
cmake --install build --prefix ~/.local   # → ~/.local/{bin,lib,include/rakupp}
```

On Windows (MSVC), build from a *Developer Command Prompt* and pass the
configuration to the build step — the Visual Studio generator is
multi-config, so `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` alone is not enough:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release      # → build/Release/rakupp.exe
```

## Quick start

```sh
# Run
rakupp -e 'say "hello, world"'            # a one-liner  (build/rakupp if not installed)
rakupp path/to/program.raku               # a file
echo 'say 42' | rakupp                     # from stdin
```

`rakupp` locates the runtime library `--exe` needs relative to its own binary, so
it works from any directory whether run out of `build/` or from an install
prefix. If you copy the binary somewhere on its own, point it back with
`RAKUPP_HOME=<prefix>`.

```sh
build/rakupp -e 'say (1..100).grep(*.is-prime).sum'    # → 1060
```

## Common options

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FILE` / `-e 'CODE'` / *(stdin)* | Run a program from a file, a one-liner, or standard input |
| `-I <path>` | Add a directory to the module search path (repeatable) |
| `--exe SRC -o OUT` | Native-compile to a standalone binary (also `--bundle`, `--aot`) |
| `--highlight [SRC]` | Syntax-highlight Raku to HTML (`--html`) or terminal (`--ansi`) |
| `--lint SRC` | Static-analyze without running: unused variables, unreachable code, etc. ([LINT.md](docs/LINT.md)) |
| `--ast SRC` | Print the parsed AST |
| `--cpp SRC [-O]` | Print the C++ that `--exe` transpiles to (add `-O` to see the optimized codegen) |
| `--help`, `--version` | Show help / version |

`RAKUPP_PARALLEL=1` opts into true CPU parallelism for `start`/worker threads
(default coordinates under a GIL). Full option and environment-variable reference:

## Run Raku in the browser — Raku.js

▶ **Try it live: [raku.online](https://raku.online/)**

**[Raku.js](rakujs/)** is the *same* interpreter compiled to **WebAssembly** with
Emscripten — the exact semantics as native `rakupp`, running entirely client-side
with no server. It powers an in-page [playground](rakujs/playground/) (editor +
live output, with all the [examples/](examples/) built in) and can be embedded in
any static page to make Raku snippets runnable — handy for docs, tutorials, or a
course. Build it with `rakujs/build.sh`; details in
[rakujs/README.md](rakujs/README.md).
